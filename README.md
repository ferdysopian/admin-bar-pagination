# Admin Bar Pagination

A WordPress plugin I created to solve a real problem I encountered while working on a client's website. They had installed numerous plugins that each added their own menu items to the WordPress admin toolbar, making it extremely cluttered and almost unusable on smaller screens. This plugin adds pagination functionality to the WordPress admin toolbar, allowing you to navigate through menu items efficiently.

## What it does

- Shows 3 menu items per page (configurable)
- Keeps WordPress logo and site name always visible
- Adds Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Works on mobile devices
- Lightweight and fast

## Installation

1. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/admin-bar-pagination/`
2. Activate the plugin
3. Configure in Settings > Admin Bar Pagination

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
