Adds pagination to the WordPress admin toolbar so it never overflows, wraps, or spills into the page when too many items are shown. A clean alternative to admin bar overflow fixes and UI hacks.

== Description ==

The WordPress admin bar gets crowded fast, plugins add their own items, menus stack up, and suddenly things wrap, overlap, or become unusable on mobile. This plugin solves that by adding simple pagination right inside the admin toolbar.

Instead of items overflowing or wrapping onto multiple lines, the toolbar stays compact and consistent. You choose how many items appear per page (1–10), and navigation controls handle the rest. Works on desktop and mobile without breaking the UI, layout, or user experience.

Built for anyone tired of a cluttered or overflowing admin bar, especially on smaller screens or sites with many active plugins.

**Features**
- Adds pagination to the admin bar to prevent overflow or wrapping
- Displays a fixed number of menu items per page (default: 3)
- Keeps WordPress logo and site name visible at all times
- Works on mobile and responsive layouts
- Prevents admin bar items from overlapping content
- Lightweight and loads only when the admin bar is displayed
- Helps manage crowded or plugin-heavy admin toolbars
